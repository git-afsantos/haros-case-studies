# FASTEN Project

## System

The [FASTEN project](http://www.fastenmanufacturing.eu/index.php/project/) is a complete stack of ROS-based software powering a mobile manipulator operating in an industrial environment.
It provides an open and standardised framework to produce and deliver tailor-designed products, capable of running autonomously and deliver fast and low-cost additive manufactured products.

## Analysis

Neto et al. used HAROS to analyse the FASTEN European Project.
The analyses performed in this study aim to assess and improve the internal code quality of the project (e.g., compliance with metrics and coding standards).
Successive iterations of analysis and improvement solved 25,440 reported issues, representing an overall reduction of 90%.
