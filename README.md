# HAROS Case Studies

This repository holds a collection of case studies of the [HAROS framework](https://github.com/git-afsantos/haros/).
If possible (i.e., if the information can be made public), each case study should document:

- the analysed ROS system;
- the versions of ROS and HAROS;
- which HAROS plugins were used;
- special requirements;
- the analysis workflow as a whole;
- steps to approach/implement the intended analysis;
- artefacts obtained as a result of the analysis;
- faults and failures detected with HAROS;
- changes to the system in order to fix the detected issues.

If you used HAROS to analyse and improve a robotic system, we invite you to add your case study to this collection.
